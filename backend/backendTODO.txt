API protection  needs to be done : eg . normal user shouldnt be able to access api's that handles books CRUD
sol : require admin middleware that check userType from cookie token



TODO :   // handle if book is return then allow user to request new book ,
    // if 2nd book is also returned then only allow 3rd book else REJECT request

    MAJOR ISSUE : previously tyo book liyeko xa vane cant buy it next time ?
