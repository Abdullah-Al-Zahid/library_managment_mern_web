    description: `The principles and practices of Tantra are revealed by one of the greatest spiritual teachers of the twentieth century in The Book of Secrets: 112 Meditations to Discover the Mystery Within.

In this comprehensive and practical guide, the secrets of the ancient science of Tantra become available to a contemporary audience. Confined to small, hidden mystery schools for centuries, and often misunderstood and misinterpreted today. Tantra is not just a collection of techniques to enhance sexual experience. As Osho shows in these pages, it is a complete science of self-realization, based on the cumulative wisdom of centuries of exploration into the meaning of life and consciousness. Tantra―the very word means “technique”―is a set of powerful, transformative tools that can be used to bring new meaning and joy to every aspect of our daily lives.`,

Is it really possible to be in a relationship and still have a life outside of the "we" identity?
What are the real differences between men and women and how they view relationships, versus the differences that we’ve just been conditioned to have?`,
